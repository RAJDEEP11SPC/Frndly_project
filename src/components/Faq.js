          "All dogs love food. But not all food loves them back."
It is quite common to see people feeding dogs snacks at the chai kade. Biscuits are not ideal but it’s not the worst thing. But it is easy to make mistakes and accidentally feed dogs food that makes them ill or worse, kills them.
Common food to avoid:
Chocolate, grapes, raisins, cherries, caffeine, onion and garlic, alcohol, xylitol, milk and blue cheese.

          As a moral citizen, it might be difficult to turn away from this. Good. This means you care- and that is the first step towards saving a dog. But in order to effectively uphold your moral responsibilities, you will need to have a solid approach.
There are several laws in place to take care of the rights of dogs- under the Fundamental Right to Life and the Prevention Against Cruelty to Animals Act. As a citizen, it is your responsibility to uphold the values on which these laws are based and speak out if required.
