                "All dogs love food. But not all food loves them back." It is
                quite common to see people feeding dogs snacks at the chai kade.
                Biscuits are not ideal but it’s not the worst thing. But it is
                easy to make mistakes and accidentally feed dogs food that makes
                them ill or worse, kills them. Common food to avoid: Chocolate,
                grapes, raisins, cherries, caffeine, onion and garlic, alcohol,
                xylitol, milk and blue cheese.

                Since dogs can’t tell you about how they feel examining your dog
                routinely for any changes from normal, thereby identifying and
                addressing medical problems before pronounced symptoms appear,
                is the best way of assuring a long and healthy life.There are
                many signs of a dog’s health in the dog’s body and excretion.
                Here’s a quick way of reading them:
                <p>(i) Checking the temperature</p>
                <p>(ii) Checking the Mouth</p>
                <p>(iii) Checking eyes</p>
                <p>(iv) Taking your dog's pulse</p>
                <p>
                  (v) Watching stools for consistency, or for vomiting and
                  diarrhea
                </p>
                <p>(vi) Watching your dogs’ breathing</p>
                <p>(vii) Watching your dog’s balance</p>
                <p>(viii) Watching for a loss of appetite</p>

                As a moral citizen, it might be difficult to turn away from
                this. Good. This means you care- and that is the first step
                towards saving a dog. But in order to effectively uphold your
                moral responsibilities, you will need to have a solid approach.
                There are several laws in place to take care of the rights of
                dogs- under the Fundamental Right to Life and the Prevention
                Against Cruelty to Animals Act. As a citizen, it is your
                responsibility to uphold the values on which these laws are
                based and speak out if required.
                <p>1. Approach your neighbour directly</p>
                <p>2. Understand the context</p>
                <p>3. Learn and educate</p>
                <p>4. Remember your priority: the dog</p>
